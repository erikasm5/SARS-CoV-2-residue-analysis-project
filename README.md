# Structural and Binding Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variants with ACE2 Receptor

## Project Overview
This project, originally for the DTU course 22117, investigates structural and functional changes in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) variants and their interactions with the human ACE2 receptor. The focus was on comparing the wild-type, Omicron, and XBB.1.16 variants to understand changes in binding affinity, flexibility, and potential implications for virulence.

## Content
- **Code and Scripts**: Analysis scripts for finding ORFs, mutational analysis, and interaction mapping.
- **Data**: Includes necessary sequences and scaffold data in `scaffolds.fasta`.
- **Results**: Plots and figures from the structural and binding analyses, located in the `plots` folder.
- **Not Used Scripts**: Contains additional code snippets that were part of exploration but not used in final analysis.

## Key Findings
- **Binding Affinity**: Increased binding interactions were observed for B.1.1.529 compared to wild-type.
- **Flexibility Analysis**: RBD residues in the wild-type showed higher flexibility, especially residues 445 and 449, than in Omicron and XBB.1.16.
- **Mutational Scans**: Scans suggest that Y501 might persist in future variants, while 417 and 484 may revert to wild-type sequences.
